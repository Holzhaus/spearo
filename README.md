# Spearo

An android app to manage a speaker roster during a discussion.

## Where does the name come from?

I'm not that creative, so it's simply derived from "speaker roster". Yup, that's all there is.

## Will my data be kept private?

As far as Spearo is concerned, your data will stay private. Look at the source, or at the app permissions - Spearo doesn't even requests permission to access the network/internet. But please keep in mind: Your private data will only be as safe as the device it is stored on. Even if you got rid of your stock ROM and use an open-source version like AOKP or Cyanogen, chances are that they still need proprietary firmware/driver BLOBs to run on your device. If that's the case, you cannot be sure that there are no security flaws or backdoors. So if your data is really secret, do not put it on your phone.

You should also note that Spearo currently does not encrypt your data.
